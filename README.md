# Today's NHL Games :ice_hockey:
A Typescript-based, API-first NHL fan dashboard, making use of [some amazing work](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/blob/master/stats-api.md) done by a couple of lovely people, somehow documenting the existing nhl API. Currently the client handles all requests as the endpoint is public, and uses react-bootstrap for layout and a few helpful components. Lots of things need to be fixed or added :)

## Install
